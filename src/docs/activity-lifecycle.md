#Android Dev - Activity Lifecycle

(this is a mini tutorial that can be completed at any time)

## 1. Intro

The aim of this tutorial is to look at how the activity lifecycle works which looks like this:

> for more information take a look at (https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/activity-lifecycle.html) There's also a really great video by Kristin Marsicano (https://realm.io/news/activities-in-the-wild-exploring-the-activity-lifecycle-android/)

## 2. Logging

Firstly, we’re going to implement the different activity lifecycle methods. Android Studio has a lot of keyboard shortcuts which will write a lot of the code for us! On Mac OS Z press <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>n</kbd> and on Windows press <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Insert</kbd> . Here you can select `Override methods` and find the methods listed above.

We’re then going to write ourselves some Log messages. If you’ve ever written any JavaScript, this is the same as `console.log`. These we can check in the Android Monitor (probably a button at the bottom of your window in Android Studio) which methods are being called.

When you first look in the Android Monitor, you’ll notice **a lot** of messages coming through. We can filter out which ones we care about by using a tag, like so:

> this is what my code looks like

Run this on a real device (or an emulator) and test it out and answer with your coach the following questions:

1. What methods get called when the app first starts up?
2. What methods get called if I go home and come back into the app?
3. What methods get called if I kill the app, and then open it again?

## 3. Gotchas

Which methods get called if you rotate your device?

Is that what you expected?

What other things could you do to your device that might destroy and re-create your activity? (Hint: changing the language)

Has it ever caused an app they’ve written to crash, or behave in a way they didn’t intend?

## 4. Pop quiz

For the following questions, do you think they are true or false?


1. After **onCreate**, the activity is now visible to the user to interact with.
2. **onStart** always gets called every time the user comes back into the activity.
3. **onResume** always gets called when you return to the activity, regardless of whether you killed the activity or just briefly left it.
4. an activity in **onPause** can still be visible on the screen.
5. **onDestroy** is the best place to save anything a user did so they can see it when they come back.
