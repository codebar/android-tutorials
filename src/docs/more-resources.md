# Resources for Android Development

Everyone will need **Android Studio** - https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html

If youâ€™d like to pick it up on your own, the **Big Nerd Ranch** have a really very good book to pick up Android (they have an iOS book too) - https://www.bignerdranch.com/we-write/

**Amal** has written a more advanced android tutorial located at https://github.com/K4KYA/MakersHelloAndroid/tree/codebar if you want to take Android even further :)

**Google** also has their own tutorial series at https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html, which touches on some of the details and complexities of Android app development - saving data, sharing things with other apps, getting location data and other things you may want a more complex app to be able to do.

**Udacity** also have a super course available which women can apply for a scholarship here https://www.udacity.com/google-scholarships
